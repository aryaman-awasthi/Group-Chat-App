# Group Chat App

A flutter group chat app using clean code architecture.

### Packages I am using:


[flutter_bloc :](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc)  Widgets that make it easy to integrate blocs and cubits into [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). Built to work with [package:bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/bloc). The Bloc library provides very good ðŸ¦„ tooling and compared to other state management solutions that use Streams, it's a pure gem.

[get_it :](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it) This is a simple **Service Locator** for Dart and Flutter projects with some additional goodies highly inspired by [Splat](https://github.com/reactiveui/splat). It can be used instead of `InheritedWidget` or `Provider` to access objects e.g. from your UI.

[equatable:](https://pub.dev/packages/equatable) Being able to compare objects in `Dart` often involves having to override the `==` operator as well as `hashCode`.


custom_image_picker:- [Link:](https://pub.dev/packages/custom_image_picker)

bubble:- [Link:](https://pub.dev/packages/bubble)

agora_rtc_engine:- [Link:](https://pub.dev/packages/agora_rtc_engine)


font_awesome_flutter:- [Link:](https://pub.dev/packages/font_awesome_flutter)


[firebase :](https://firebase.google.com/) is the most amazing back-end as a service (BaaS) developed by Google for mobile and web application development that helps you build, improve, grow your app and deliver richer app experiences.

[firebase_storage : ](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_storage) Cloud Storage for Firebase is a powerful, simple, and cost-effective object storage service built for Google scale. The Firebase SDKs for Cloud Storage add Google security to file uploads and downloads for your Firebase apps, regardless of network quality.

[cloud_firestore : ](https://pub.dev/packages/cloud_firestore) Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud Platform.

[firebase_auth :](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_auth) Firebase Authentication aims to make building secure authentication systems easy, while improving the sign-in and onboarding experience for end users. It provides an end-to-end identity solution, supporting email and password accounts, phone auth, and Google, Twitter, Facebook, and GitHub login, and more.
